\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chp:conclusions}



This thesis presented an autonomous \gls{llm} triage pipeline that combines with the \glsxtrlong{mcp} (\glsxtrshort{mcp}) to analyse \emph{native crashes} in Android applications.  
The goal was to support vulnerability assessment in scenarios where manual crash inspection is time-consuming and labour-intensive, and where applications rely on native components accessed through the \glsxtrlong{jni}.


The proposed system integrates the reverse-engineering tools, \emph{Jadx} for bytecode analysis and \emph{Ghidra} for native disassembly, into the \gls{llm}’s reasoning loop, enabling context-aware classification of \emph{POIROT}-generated crashes.  
The evaluation demonstrates that the pipeline reliably identifies real vulnerabilities, achieving low false-negative rates and providing structured explanations, confidence scores, and evidence traces.  
The TP-LINK tpCamera case study further shows that the system can approximate expert-level analysis: the \gls{llm} classification aligns with the ground-truth vulnerability reported in PIROT (CVE-2023-30273), correctly identifying the unsafe lifecycle of the encoder context and the conditions leading to a use-after-free.

At the same time, the results highlight several limitations.  
Precision remains modest, due to incomplete crash traces and the conservative behaviour of general-purpose \glspl{llm}, which tend to over-approximate risk when information is missing.  
These results indicate that such a system should not replace traditional analyses, but rather serve as an integrative tool that accelerates classification and provides a structured starting point for further and more precise investigation.

The work demonstrates the viability of using \glspl{llm} to enhance automated vulnerability triage, offering an approach that scales to applications with native components and reduces the manual effort required for initial crash assessment.

\textcolor{red}{non so se ha senso riparlare di future work qui}\\
Future work should focus on improving precision through richer static and dynamic context, extending Java–to–native call-graph reconstruction. Integrating automated exploitability assessment and symbolic reasoning layers could also further strengthen the system’s reliability.  

\textcolor{red}{di nuovo un recap}\\
In conclusion, this thesis shows that \gls{llm}-based crash triage, when combined with reverse-engineering tools through \gls{mcp}, offers a promising direction for scalable vulnerability analysis.  
It enhances the efficiency and consistency of the triage process and provides a practical foundation for more advanced, context-aware security automation.
